<p><strong></p>
<p>Abstract:</strong> Virtually all organizations are having to deal with Big Data in many contexts: marketing, operations, monitoring, performance, and even financial management. Big Data is characterized not just by its size, but by its Velocity and its Variety for which keeping up with the data flux, let alone its analysis, is challenging at best and impossible in many cases. In this talk I will cover some of the basics in terms of infrastructure and design considerations for effective an efficient BigData. In many organizations, the lack of consideration of effective infrastructure and data management leads to unnecessarily expensive systems for which the benefits are insufficient to justify the costs. We will refer to example frameworks and clarify the kinds of operations where Map-Reduce (Hadoop and and its derivatives) are appropriate and the situations where other infrastructure is needed to perform segmentation, prediction, analysis, and reporting appropriately – these being the fundamental operations in predictive analytics. We will thenpay specific attention to on-line data and the unique challenges and opportunities represented there. We cover examples of Predictive Analytics over Big Data with case studies in eCommerce Marketing, on-line publishing and recommendation systems, and advertising targeting: Special focus will be placed on the analysis of on-line data with applications in Search, Search Marketing, and targeting of advertising. We conclude with some technical challenges as well as the solutions that can be used to these challenges in social network data.</p>

<p><strong>Title: Rapid Learning Systems to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bigmine.github.io/bigmine12/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/headshot_Bharat_Rao.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-119" title="Bharat_Rao" alt="" src="https://bigmine.github.io/bigmine12/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/headshot_Bharat_Rao-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>Bharat Rao, PhD is Senior Director and Head of the newly-formed Center for Innovations in the Health Services (HS) business unit in Siemens Healthcare, headquartered in Malvern PA. The Siemens HS unit develops and markets enterprise information technology and business intelligence solutions for hospitals and other healthcare providers. The Center for Innovations was established in May 2012 with the vision to foster thought-leadership for Siemens in the dynamic field of healthcare IT. The Center’s goals are to create a continuous-innovation pipeline of new products, services and capabilities; to develop and rollout processes to translate innovation into commercial success; establish collaborations with luminary customers, academic &amp; industry partners; and to drive an innovation agenda that impacts the entire HS portfolio and workforce.</p>
<p>Previously, Dr. Rao led the Knowledge Solutions group, Healthcare Analytics and Business Intelligence which develops and deploys data analytics solutions that analyze millions of patient records, impacting three major areas in healthcare. These include, automated quality measurement and decision-support from hospitals EMR’s, computer-aided diagnosis systems to identify suspicious lesions on medical images, and predictive models for personalized medicine. The group launched the first-to-market startup offering in healthcare quality, Soarian Quality Measures (and its cloud counterpart, the Quality Reporting Service) which is now an essential part of Siemens solution to satisfy the meaningful use requirements for US health reform.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<p>Abstract:</strong> Trends over the past two decades indicate that the quantity and precision of diagnostic data available for a single patient has increased dramatically, the amount of published medical knowledge is doubling every few years, and a number of promising therapies have been developed. Despite all these advances, medicine remains largely mired in a ‘one size fits all’ paradigm that has led to an explosive increase in patient costs without a concomitant improvement in patient care.</p>
<p>We are on the verge of a paradigm shift in healthcare. Traditionally, medical knowledge has being derived from carefully conducted clinical studies, namely evidence-based-medicine; now, a new form of evidence is emerging – that created by rapid learning systems that will mine vast amounts of electronic patient data collected in routine care, to create “evidence generated medicine.” Thus, mining the millions of patient records collected routinely in the daily care of patients has tremendous potential to individualize care to the specific patient.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I will describe a first-of-its-kind US/Euro health IT network consisting of 10 cancer centers in 5 nations. In this network, cancer centers are able to securely learn personalized models from patient data collected across all centers. Learned models for predicting patient survival and side effects for 3 different cancers (lung, rectal, larynx) have been made available to the public and physicians at www.predictcancer.org .</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The vision of Aliyun is to become an Internet Data Sharing Platform. We realize that the next frontier of Big Data depends on effectively managing, using, and exploiting these heterogeneous data. It is now possible to extract knowledge and useful information in ways that were previously impossible, and to gain new insights in a timely manner. In this presentation, Firstly, I will introduce the big data collections at Aliyun, which include the whole Web content and user accessing log. Then, I will give an introduction about the infrastructure for processing the Big Data and show some typical applications on that platform. Finally, some challenging issues will be proposed for processing and mining the big data.</p>

<p><strong> Abstract:</strong> In machine learning, scale adds complexity. The most obvious consequence of scale is that data takes longer to process. At certain points, however, scale makes trivial operations costly, thus forcing us to re-evaluate algorithms in light of the complexity of those operations. Here, we will discuss one important way a general large scale machine learning setting may differ from the standard supervised classification setting and show some the results of some preliminary experiments highlighting this difference. The results suggest that there is potential for significant improvement beyond obvious solutions.</p>

<p><strong> Abstract:</strong> Business analytics, occupying the intersection of the worlds of management science, computer science and statistical science, is a potent force for innovation in both the private and public sectors. The successes of business analytics in strategy, process optimization and competitive advantage has led to data being increasingly recognized as a valuable asset in many organizations. In recent years, thanks to a dramatic increase in the volume, variety and velocity of data, the loosely defined concept of “Big Data” has emerged as a topic of discussion in its own right – with different viewpoints in both the business and technical worlds. From our perspective, it is important for discussions of “Big Data” to start from a well-defined business goal, and remain moored to fundamental principles of both cost/benefit analysis as well as core statistical science. This note discusses some business case considerations for analytics projects involving “Big Data”, and proposes key questions that businesses should ask. With practical lessons from Big Data deployments in business, we also pose a number of research challenges that may be addressed to enable the business analytics community bring best data analytic practices when confronted with massive data sets.</p>
